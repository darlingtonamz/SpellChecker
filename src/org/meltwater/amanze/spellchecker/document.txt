The silky sifaka (Propithecus candidus) is a large lemur with silky white fur that lives in northeastern Madagascar. 
It is listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as one of the world's 25 most critically endangered primates. 
The silky sifaka lives in groups of two to nine and spends most of its day feeding, resting, playing, grooming, and traveling. 
Like other eastern sifakas, it eats leaves and seeds, but also fruit, flowers, and even soil. 
As with other sifaka species, group members will groom, play with, carry, and nurse infants that are not their own. 
Adults vocalize frequently despite having only seven different calls. 
Like all lemurs, it relies strongly on scent for communication; males frequently scent-mark. 
The species is found in the rainforests of northeastern Madagascar, with the remaining population in Marojejy National Park,
